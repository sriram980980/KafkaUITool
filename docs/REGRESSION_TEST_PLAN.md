## Test Categories

### ✅ Core Application Tests
- [x] **TC001**: Application Launch - Verifies JavaFX application starts without errors
- [x] **TC007**: Search Icon Integration - Verifies UI changes implemented correctly
- [x] **TC009**: Menu Integration - Verifies unified search functionality

### 🟡 Manual Integration Tests (Require Live Kafka Cluster)
- [ ] **TC002-TC006**: Cluster and Topic CRUD Operations
- [ ] **TC008**: Advanced Search Functionality  
- [ ] **TC013-TC016**: Admin Menu Functions
- [ ] **TC018-TC020**: Message Operations

### ✅ Enterprise Feature Tests
- [x] **TC010**: Kafka Connect UI Loading
- [x] **TC011**: Kafka Connect Service Implementation
- [x] **TC012**: Metrics Dashboard UI Loading
- [x] **TC017**: Schema Registry UI Loading

## Test Environment Setup

### Prerequisites for Manual Testing
1. **Java 17+** installed
2. **Apache Kafka** cluster running (e.g., localhost:9092)
3. **Kafka Connect** cluster running (e.g., localhost:8083) - for connector tests
4. **Sample topics** with data for message testing

### Test Data Requirements
- At least 1 Kafka cluster configured
- At least 3 test topics with different partition counts
- Sample messages in various formats (JSON, plain text, Avro)
- At least 1 consumer group active

## Automated Test Execution

### Build Tests
```bash
./mvnw clean test
```

### UI Component Tests
```bash
# TestFX tests for UI components (when implemented)
./mvnw test -Dtest=*UITest
```

## Issue Tracking

### Known Issues
- [ ] Metrics Dashboard service implementation needed
- [ ] Connector creation UI workflow needs completion
- [ ] Advanced search needs full testing with live data

### Fixed Issues
- [x] ✅ Kafka Connect service was missing implementation
- [x] ✅ Search icon was missing from Messages panel
- [x] ✅ File menu search was different from Tools menu search

## Regression Test Schedule

### Daily Builds
- Run TC001 (Application Launch)
- Run automated unit tests

### Weekly Integration Testing
- Run TC002-TC020 with live Kafka cluster
- Verify all UI components load correctly
- Test basic CRUD operations

### Release Testing
- Complete full regression test suite
- Performance testing with large datasets
- Cross-platform testing (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- Documentation review and updates

## Test Results Legend
- ✅ **PASS**: Test executed successfully, meets expected result
- ❌ **FAIL**: Test executed but failed, requires investigation
- 🟡 **MANUAL**: Test requires manual execution with external dependencies
- ⏸️ **SKIP**: Test skipped due to dependencies or environment issues
- 🔄 **RETRY**: Test needs to be re-executed

## Contact & Reporting
- Report issues via GitHub Issues
- Test results should be updated in this document
- Critical failures should be escalated immediately
